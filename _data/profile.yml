first_paragraph: I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Bioinformatics working with <a href="https://xinglab.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Yi Xing</a> at the UCLA 
 Bioinformatics IDP/Children's Hospital of Philadephia. 
 Currently my research is focused on leveraging big data analytics to elucidate the regulatory basis in the human transcriptomes. 
 My long term goal is to predict and interpret the phenotypic and molecular trait variations by integrating multi-omics data and 
 biological regulatory patterns in health and disease. <br /> 
second_paragraph: I obtained my B.Sc. degree from Zhejiang University. During my undergrad, I worked with <a href="http://bis.zju.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Dr. Ming Chen</a> 
 for three years to study the regulatory and metabolic networks of <i>Oryza Sativa</i> using computational and 
 systems biology approaches.
