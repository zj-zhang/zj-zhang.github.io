second_paragraph: I obtained my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics with <a href="https://xinglab.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Yi Xing</a> at UCLA, with research focus on elucidating the regulatory basis of  human transcriptomes. While at UCLA, I also pursued a Master's degree in Statistics with <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/"> Dr. Ying Nian Wu </a>, studying automated machine learning and deep learning methods. During my undergrad at Zhejiang University, I worked with <a href="http://bis.zju.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Dr. Ming Chen</a> for three years to study the metabolic networks using computational and systems biology approaches.
