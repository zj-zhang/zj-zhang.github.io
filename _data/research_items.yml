  background: The rapid accumulation of RNA-seq data across diverse cell types and conditions provides an unprecedented resource 
    for characterizing transcriptome complexity. However, the use of these large-scale data in routine RNA-seq studies to detect 
    patterns of expression and thereby discover new regulatory events has been limited. 
  description: Conceptually, the DARTS framework transforms existing RNA-seq big data into a splicing knowledge-base by deep learning, 
    and help democratize the information from large consortium projects to help individual investigators better characterize alternative 
    splicing profiles using their specific RNA-seq datasets. <a href="#" target="_blank">Read More</a>

- name: Statistics Reveals Novel Regulatory Patterns
  url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zj-zhang/picture_store/master/my-githubio-homepage/CLAM.jpg
  background: CLIP/RIP-seq allows transcriptome-wide discovery of RNA regulatory sites. As CLIP-seq/RIP-seq reads are short, existing computational tools focus on uniquely mapped reads, while reads mapped to multiple loci are discarded. 
  description: CLAM uses a statistical algorithm called "Expectation–Maximization" to assign multi-mapped reads and calls peaks combining uniquely and 
    multi-mapped reads. CLAM provides a useful tool to discover novel protein–RNA interactions and RNA modification sites from CLIP-seq 
    and RIP-seq data, and reveals the significant contribution of repetitive elements to the RNA regulatory landscape of the human 
    transcriptome. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/16/9260/4077049" target="_blank">Read More</a>
