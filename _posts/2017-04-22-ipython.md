If you are using Anaconda 64-bit Ver. Dec. 20 2016 and try to start jupyter notebook by typing in your shell:
```
ipython notebook
```
This will likely throw an error message "ImportError: No module named shutil_get_terminal_size". To solve this problem, simply do the following 3 steps:

{:toc}

### Step 1
a) use `vim` to open this file (in my case, it is ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/utils/terminal.py)Â that throws this error, find the line that tries to import `get_terminal_size` module, and then make the following changes:

```
try:
    import backports.shutil_get_terminal_size
except ImportError:
    from shutil_backports import get_terminal_size as shutil_get_terminal_size
```

### Step 2
b) Now try `ipython notebook`; still doesn't work. The error message is now "ImportError: No module named notebook.notebookapp". To solve this, simple use pip in your shell:

```
pip install jupyter
```


### Step 3
c) Now type `ipython notebook` in your shell.

Hooray!! You are ready to go!
