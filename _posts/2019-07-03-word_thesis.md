A note on writing a PhD thesis in MS Word


Below is a simple note on a few formatting tricks in Microsoft Word 
for PhD thesis writing. Briefly, this needs to account for how to make
a proper page numbering, table of contents, and references to list of
figures and tables.




* content
{:toc}


__Page Numbering__

1. use "Layout" --> "Breaks" to insert "Sections/Continous" to separate different Chapters 
into different sections.

2. Go to the very first page. Under "Insert", use "Page Number" --> "Bottom of Page" --> 
"Plain Number 2". We shall return to format the prefix into Roman numbering later in a few
steps.

3. Find the first page of Chapter 1, then double-click on the footer page number; this will 
pop up a ribbon "Design" on top. In "Design" tab, find the highlighted "Link to Previous", 
click to uncheck it. This will allow the page numbering to start fresh for this section.

4. In the "Design" tab, find "Page Number" --> "Format Page Numbers", then in the poped-up window,
set "Start at: 1". Now the Prefix and Chapters have separated numbering.

5. Go back to the first page of the Prefix, again use "Format Page Numbers" and set "Number Format"
to Roman Numbering for the Prefix.


__Add Table of Contents__

1. Format the Section and Subsection heading by "Home" --> "Heading 1/2/3".

2. In the ToC page, click "References" --> "Table of Contents".

3. In "Home" tab, right-click on the "Heading 1/2/3" and "Modify.." to change the heading
to the same style of the main texts. This includes font, bold, and paragraph (which usually
is double spacing).

__Add List of Figures__

1. Set cursor at the first
chapter location (e.g. "Chapter 1"), then in "Home" tab, select "Multilevel list" --> "Chapter".
("Multilevel list" is in "Home/Paragraph" group and above "Aligning" buttons.)
This will create a list for all chapters and the corresponding sections/subsections. 


2. Select the caption of a particular figure, then "References" --> "Insert Caption".
In "Numbering..", select "Including chapter number", and set "Use separator" is ". period". 
Make sure the label is "Figure" as not to be mixed with "Tables".

3. In the Prefix/List of Figures page, from "References" --> "Table of Figure Dialog", insert
the list.

4. Format the Caption in "Home" tab, similar to the above.
