## Biomedical Data Mining

Hi there. My name is Zijun Zhang. During my Ph.D. years, I gained experiences in Statistics and big data analytics. I am a firm 
believer that deep learning (a.k.a. artificial intelligence) will have a profound impact to every aspect in our life in the very near
future. Compared to the most cutting-edge advances comes from computer vision or robotics, A.I. applications tend to be more 
"basic-science" in biomedical or biological fields. However, as moving forward, Bio-related fields will (quickly) become one of the 
most feature-rich data sources that provides unique challenges and opportunites to deep learning.

Biological and biomedical data have their distinct characteristics compared to data being used in modern deep learning studies. Most 
notably, there are severe over-dispersion issues in common bio-related data. This is because the measurements for most bio traits are 
not precise and subject to variations at multiple levels. 

## Why study Bioinformatics?

My interests of programming dates back to early days in my childhood. I first learned Visual Basic in elementary school through the
book "Game Programming with Visual Basic in 21 Days" by Clayton Walnum. Although I was only able to read through to the first few days
at that time, I managed to programmed a small whack-a-mole type game and had a lot of fun playing with friends.

Before coming to UCLA for grad school, I completed my B.Sc. degree from College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University. I was lucky enough to have skipped the National College Entrance Exams by being recommended for admission directly to ZJU from my high school; however, I was
unlucky to be majored in English. Hence when I heard a new biology class was recruiting students at ZJU, I did not
hesitate to sign up for the interview, and got admitted there. At that time I did not know Bioinformatics and thought I was going to 
conduct biological experiments. However the first time I held a pipette in my hands, I realized I am not suitable to do any 
experiments. That's when I started looking actively to use computer programming to solve biology problems.


## I'm a Gamer
Programming and games played an important role in my childhood. Even today I still play games from time to time, and 
enjoy doing so.
