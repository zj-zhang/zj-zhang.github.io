## Biomedical Data Mining

Hi there. My name is Zijun Zhang. During my Ph.D. years, I gained experiences in Statistics and big data analytics. I am a firm 
believer that deep learning (a.k.a. artificial intelligence) will have a profound impact to every aspect in our life in the very near
future. While the most cutting-edge advances coming from computer vision or robotics, A.I. applications tend to be more 
"basic-science" in biomedical or biological fields. However, as moving forward, Bio-related fields will (quickly) become one of the 
most feature-rich data sources that provides unique challenges and opportunites to deep learning.

Biological and biomedical data have their distinct characteristics compared to data being used in modern deep learning studies. Most 
notably, there are severe over-dispersion issues in common bio-related data. This is because the measurements for most bio traits are 
not precise and subject to variations at multiple levels. 

## Why study Bioinformatics?

My interests of programming dates back to early days in my childhood. I first learned Visual Basic in elementary school through the
book "Game Programming with Visual Basic in 21 Days" by Clayton Walnum. Although I was only able to read through to the first few days
at that time (I barely understand English then), I managed to programmed a small whack-a-mole type game and had a lot of fun playing with friends.

Before coming to UCLA for grad school, I completed my B.Sc. degree from College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University. I was lucky enough to have skipped the National College Entrance Exams by being recommended for admission directly to ZJU from my high school; however, I was
unlucky to be majored in English. Hence when I heard a new biology class was recruiting students at ZJU, I did not
hesitate to sign up for the interview, and got admitted there. At that time I did not know Bioinformatics and thought I was going to 
conduct biological experiments. However the first time I held a pipette in my hands, I realized I am not suitable to do any 
experiments. That's when I started looking actively to use computer programming to solve biology problems.


## Our Guinea Pig Fei-Fei
Liangke and I bought a Guinea pig back in April 2018. We decided to name him
Fei-Fei (肥肥), which means fat-fat in Chinese. Fei-Fei is a long-haired Guinea pig.

Fei-fei's favorate activity is eating; and as a result, we leveraged his enthusiasms in eating to train
him do a bunch of different tricks. He looks really fluffy and cute, and has a pretty good temper.

At the moment Fei-fei can do: spin, stand up, jump through a loop, pick up balls, put balls in a basket, push a tennis ball, and walk in a tunel.


## Video Games
Programming and video games played an important role in my childhood. Even today I still play games from time to time, and 
enjoy doing so. Starting from elementary school I got fanscinated by the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (ROTK) series from KOEI. 
KOEI releases a new ROTK installment every 2 or 3 years. Since then, I have played each one from ROTK 6(somewhere around 2002?) all the way to 13PK(released 2017). That's probably more than 15 years!

For a while in junior high school I played Counter-Striker and got pretty good at it.

Sometimes I wonder if it's true that anyone enjoys coding should also enjoy gaming?! That seems to be case at least for people around me.
