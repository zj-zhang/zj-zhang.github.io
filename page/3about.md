## Our Guinea Pigs
Liangke and I bought our first Guinea pig back in April 2018. We decided to name him
Fei-Fei (肥肥), which means fat-fat in Chinese. Fei-Fei is a long-haired Guinea pig.

Fei-fei's favorate activity is eating; and as a result, we leveraged his enthusiasms in eating to train
him do a bunch of different tricks. He looks really fluffy and cute, and has a really good temper.

At the moment Fei-fei can do: spin, stand up, jump through a loop, pick up balls, put balls in a basket, push a tennis ball, and walk in a tunel.

<i>Update on March 2020</i>: Sadly Fei-Fei left us on May 16, 2019, because of a bladder stone. T_T

Since then we have bought Hui-Hui and adopted Hua-Hua, another two long-hair Guinea pigs. They are good friends and travelled with us from Los Angeles to New York.


## Video Games
Programming and video games played an important role in my childhood. Even today I still play games from time to time, and 
enjoy doing so. Starting from elementary school I got fanscinated by the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (ROTK) series from KOEI. 
KOEI releases a new ROTK installment every 2 or 3 years. Since then, I have played each and every one in the series from ROTK 6(somewhere around 2002?) all the way to 13PK(released 2017). That's probably more than 15 years!

For a while in middle school I played Counter-Striker and got pretty good at it.

Sometimes I wonder if it's true that anyone enjoys coding should also enjoy gaming?! That seems to be case at least for people around me.
