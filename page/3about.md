## Biomedical Data Mining

Hi there. My name is Zijun Zhang. During my Ph.D. years, I gained experiences in Statistics and big data analytics. I am a firm 
believer that deep learning (a.k.a. artificial intelligence) will have a profound impact to every aspect in our life in the very near
future. Compared to the most cutting-edge advances comes from computer vision or robotics, A.I. applications tend to be more 
"basic-science" in biomedical or biological fields. However, as moving forward, Bio-related fields will (quickly) become one of the 
most feature-rich data sources that provides unique challenges and opportunites to deep learning.



## Why I study Bioinformatics?
Before coming to UCLA for grad school, I obtained my B.Sc. degree from College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University. I was lucky to
skip the National College Entrance Exams through being recommended for admission directly to ZJU from my high school; however, I was
unlucky to be admitted to study English as my major.
